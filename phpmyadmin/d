this is called a gel keyboard
I suck at this
Daniella is being too nice she doesn't wanna be honest in telling me that I suck at typing
Look at her being too nice
That's so sweet though <3

Bazil Mupisiri is good at programming because he made a whole website yeahhh
The website is called Xerroe and it is really awesome because Obama is on it
The website is not on the internet yet
Bazil should make an app
Daniella wants to work somewhere else that is cooler and less boring
She probally wants to apply the awesome copmputer science knowlege she is going to learn
in Grinnell when she declares a CS major next year after realizing she belongs to
Software Engineering and that biology is not her field so yeayyyyyh we have a new
CS major
